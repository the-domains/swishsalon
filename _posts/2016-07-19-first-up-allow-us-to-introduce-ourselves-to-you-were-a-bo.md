Welcome to our beta Swish Salon "The Grid" page. We're playing around with it & seeing if it will become our official "landing page".

First up, allow us to introduce ourselves to you! We're a boutique salon right in the heart of the Stonebriar shopping district offering a wide variety of hair services, bringing you current trends & hair "must-haves" to make your hair...well, swish!

Talking of swish, what exactly does "swish" mean? It's a term I've always used & noticed that since moving to the USA that it does attract some attention when I use it. Here's the Urban Dictionary definition: 

"Deriving from Great Britain, swish is another term for "cool" or "hip"."

There's also the US basket ball definition, which of course I believe can still apply to Swish Salon! 

"A perfect shot that goes through the basket without touching the rim."

Hey, what can I say? It's who we are!
